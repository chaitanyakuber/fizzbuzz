This little rubys script is my first foray into learning ruby. I came
across the following technical interview question and so I decided to
code it up in a language that I did not know at all. It took 15
minutes.

Problem:
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for
multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the
multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both
three and five print FizzBuzz?.
